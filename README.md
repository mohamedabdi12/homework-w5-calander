## how it works

A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is the past, present, or future. When the save button for each timeblock is triggered, the text input for that event is saved in local storage. As a user with a busy schedule, I want the user to add important events to the daily planner, so they can manage their time more effectively.
